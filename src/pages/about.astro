          <p>
            We make sanitation knowledge accessible by translating research and field
            experience into clear, step-by-step resources. Our focus is on practical
            implementation and community readiness.

          <p>
            From policy briefings to family routines, we connect the dots between
            decision-makers, operators, and households. Every story is mapped to one of
            our four pillars.
